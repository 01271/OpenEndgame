Unlike uncrating, sharking does not depend on large amounts of luck and money. You can enrich yourself for a flat sum + whatever items you trade to get what you want.<br>
In uncrating, the odds are against you, one of the reasons that unusuals are so expensive is that good ones are extremely rare.

What others have to say about uncrating:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://endgame.tf/img/whale_01.png">Ned_Ballad</a>, TF2 wiki contributor about his spending on F2P games:<br><i>"I got my first unusual in a valve game yesterday and it was a crappy courrier in Dota... I have spent about $1200 across TF2 and Dota."</i></li>

<br>
Sharking is a means to efficiently convert time into TF2 items. It is both much faster and more reliable than uncrating and scamming.<br>
Sharking entirely depends on your own skill and dedication. A scanner like tf2endgame will supply you with many tutorials, video guides and tools to find items you want but ultimately you are the one who will have to put in time to learn and win.<br>

Quite a few of these are now trusted members of large communities, the sharking they did was considered A-OK back when they did it. They are lucky.<br>
Nowadays sharking is a bit harder since ex-shark admins are better at ferreting out others thanks to their intimate knowledge of sharking.<br>
